# Stoppy

A stop motion animation app for iPhone and iPad.

My development goals for this project are: 

- to use UIKit with Storyboards. I wrote [my previous UIKit project][1] programmatically (views and Auto Layout).
- to incorporate more navigation using a Coordinator pattern.
- to mix in SwiftUI views where it makes sense, or failing that arbitrarily, to mimic the most common real-world project scenario right now.
- to document and write unit tests as I go along.
- to be more disciplined with commits so theyâ€™re clean and focused.
